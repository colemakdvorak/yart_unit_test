# Unit Tests for YART

It contains a number of examples using YART (Yet-Another-Robot-Toolbox) including
- Solving forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and inverse dynamics
- Self and external collision handling using inverse kinematics
- Computing the shortest distance between point and lines
- Machine learning methods (Gaussian processes, determinantal point processes, black-box optimization methods)
- etc

Full YART is not released yet, but a simple version of YART can be found [here](https://github.com/sjchoi86/yart_tutorial).
